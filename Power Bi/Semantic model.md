  - `product_id`: Unique identifier for the product.
  - `product_key`: Key linking to the fact table.
  - `product_line`: Product line classification.
  - `product_name`: Name of the product.
- **Relationship**: One-to-many relationship with `gold_fact_sales` via `product_key`.

### 2. üë§ `gold_dim_customers`
- **Description**: Stores customer-related data for sales analysis.
- **Fields**:
  - `birthdate`: Customer's birth date.
  - `country`: Customer's country.
  - `create_date`: Date the customer record was created.
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for the customer.
  - `customer_key`: Key linking to the fact table.
  - `customer_number`: Customer's assigned number.
  - `first_name`: Customer's first name.
  - `flag_image_URL`: URL of the country flag image.
  - `gender`: Customer's gender.
- **Relationship**: One-to-many relationship with `gold_fact_sales` via `customer_key`.

### 3. üìÖ `dim_date`
- **Description**: Provides temporal dimensions for time-based analysis.
- **Fields**:
  - `Date`: Full date.
  - `Month`: Month name or number.
  - `Month Number`: Numerical representation of the month.
  - `Quarter`: Quarter of the year.
  - `Year`: Year of the date.
- **Relationship**: One-to-many relationship with `gold_fact_sales` via date fields (e.g., `order_date`, `due_date`, `shipping_date`).

### 4. üí∞ `gold_fact_sales`
- **Description**: Central fact table containing sales transaction data.
- **Fields**:
  - `customer_key`: Foreign key linking to `gold_dim_customers`.
  - `date_diff`: Difference in days between order and due date.
  - `due_date`: Expected delivery date.
  - `order_date`: Date the order was placed.
  - `order_number`: Unique identifier for the order.
  - `price`: Price of the product.
  - `product_key`: Foreign key linking to `gold_dim_products`.
  - `quantity`: Quantity of items sold.
  - `sales_amount`: Total sales amount for the transaction.
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-one with `gold_dim_products` via `product_key`.
  - One-to-one with `gold_dim_customers` via `customer_key`.
  - One-to-many with `dim_date` via `order_date`, `due_date`, and other date fields.

## Data Relationships
- **Star Schema**: The model follows a star schema design with `gold_fact_sales` as the central fact table, surrounded by dimension tables (`gold_dim_products`, `gold_dim_customers`, and `dim_date`).
- **Cardinality**:
  - `gold_dim_products` to `gold_fact_sales`: 1:N
  - `gold_dim_customers` to `gold_fact_sales`: 1:N
  - `dim_date` to `gold_fact_sales`: 1:N

## Usage
- **Sales Analysis**: Analyze sales performance by product, customer demographics, and time periods.
- **Inventory Management**: Use product cost and maintenance data for inventory planning.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Leverage customer details for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Trend Analysis**: Utilize date dimensions to identify seasonal trends and patterns.

## Notes
- The model is optimized for reporting and analytical queries, ensuring efficient data retrieval for dashboards and visualizations.
- Ensure data integrity by maintaining unique keys across dimension and fact tables.
